## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned form validation using vanilla Javascript. I also learned about more HTML5 tags and attributes.

### Continued development

I'm improving my Javascript skills (along with HTML5 and CSS3), since this is the first time I do solo projects where I had to think about the solutions by myself from scratch.

### Useful resources
